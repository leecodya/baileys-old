                <h4 class="left">In the beginning, Brant Bailey, founder of Bailey's, started this type of work when he built a farm at the age of 21. At that time, it was just him and a shovel, and quickly realized that there needed to be more dependable help in the field, which resulted in him branching off into forming this company in 2001. He slowly started earning a name for himself in the Roberta and middle Georgia area as he continued to do local land management.</h4>

            <h4>Over the span of the past 15&plus; years, he would build up the reputation as the go-to guy that people would go to for construction and land management among farmers and landowners. Bailey's reputation has been one of the main factors of the company's, and Brant Bailey's, success. Bailey's has worked with the NRCS on numerous projects as a direct result of this. He and the company has built rapport and credibility with hundreds, if not thousands, of people in need of construction and land management. </h4>
