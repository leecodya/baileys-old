hey mr bailey, its cody lee. i apologize for the miscommunications. do you have a few moments so we can go ahead and fill out this form now?

need this info to market your company and im only able to put in so much. 

if no, when would be a good time for me to call you back today?

if dicky, it sounds like this parternship is not ideal for both of us. I have not cashed your check. what is your address so i can mail it back to you?
ill send it out to you today. would you like for me to write VOID on the check?
thank you for the chance. best of luck to you.
